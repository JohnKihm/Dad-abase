# Dad-abase

## Description

Our motivation for this project was to make a dad joke generator. This consists of having a dadabase full of dad jokes for us to pull from as well as letting users submit their own jokes to the dadabase. While not logged in users can only view jokes, however once logged in they can rate jokes they see create and edit their own jokes.
